# Music Rating WebApp

Welcome to the repo for our super cool project! This project is being worked on by Freddy Fabian and Max Oppenheimer. We're diving into the world of web development as part of the COMP 333: Software Engineering course at Wesleyan University.

## Overview

Our mission is to design and implement a static website using HTML and CSS.

## Project Description

We're creating an online music rating app where you can enter, rate, and review your favorite songs.

## Features

- **Enter Songs**
- **Rate Songs** 
- **Review Songs**

## Directories
- At the root you have the landing page (HTML file), license, gitignore and the ReadME
- Youll find the CSS file in the CSS folder

## How to run the code
- You can run it locally in the Browser using this link: https://freddy444.github.io/Songrating-Freddy.Max/ 
- You can also use live preview in Vscode to look at the code in real time
